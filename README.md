# Disable Player Reporting

This mod disables Minecraft's new Player Reporting feature, once and for all!

## Why this mod?

Many of the existing mods that claim to "disable" player reporting contain extra, unnecessary modifications to the game.
At best, these extra changes can affect your ability to play on servers that enforce secure profiles, while at worst
these might introduce "gaslight" exploits that allow you to be falsely reported by other players.

This mod does one simple thing: it disables Player Reporting. You can still play and chat securely on any multiplayer
servers like normal, and you can't get falsely reported by using this mod!

## Usage

### Client

Simply install Minecraft 1.19.1+ and Fabric Loader 0.14.8 or above, then drop this mod in your `mods/` directory. Next
time you start your game and join a server, player reporting will be disabled!  

### Server

Player Reporting is a client-side feature and the Minecraft server does not support Player Reporting. As a result, this
mod is unsupported on the server.
